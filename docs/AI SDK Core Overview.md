# AI SDK Core: Overview

[AI SDK Core](#ai-sdk-core)
---------------------------

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced programs that can understand, create, and engage with human language on a large scale. They are trained on vast amounts of written material to recognize patterns in language and predict what might come next in a given piece of text.

AI SDK Core **simplifies working with LLMs by offering a standardized way of integrating them into your app** - so you can focus on building great AI applications for your users, not waste time on technical details.

For example, hereâ€™s how you can generate text with various models using the AI SDK:

import { generateText } from "ai"

import { xai } from "@ai-sdk/xai"

const { text } = await generateText({

model: xai("grok-3-beta"),

prompt: "What is love?"

})

Love is a universal emotion that is characterized by feelings of affection, attachment, and warmth towards someone or something. It is a complex and multifaceted experience that can take many different forms, including romantic love, familial love, platonic love, and self-love.

[AI SDK Core Functions](#ai-sdk-core-functions)
-----------------------------------------------

AI SDK Core has various functions designed for [text generation](./generating-text), [structured data generation](./generating-structured-data), and [tool usage](./tools-and-tool-calling). These functions take a standardized approach to setting up [prompts](./prompts) and [settings](./settings), making it easier to work with different models.

*   [`generateText`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text): Generates text and [tool calls](./tools-and-tool-calling). This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases such as automation tasks where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.
*   [`streamText`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text): Stream text and tool calls. You can use the `streamText` function for interactive use cases such as [chat bots](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot) and [content streaming](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/completion).
*   [`generateObject`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-structured-data): Generates a typed, structured object that matches a [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema. You can use this function to force the language model to return structured data, e.g. for information extraction, synthetic data generation, or classification tasks.
*   [`streamObject`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-structured-data): Stream a structured object that matches a Zod schema. You can use this function to [stream generated UIs](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/object-generation).
