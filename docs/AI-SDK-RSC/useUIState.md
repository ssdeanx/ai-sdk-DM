# AI SDK RSC: useUIState

AI SDK RSCuseUIState

AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using AI SDK UI for production. For guidance on migrating from RSC to UI, see our migration guide.

It is a hook that enables you to read and update the UI State. The state is client-side and can contain functions, React nodes, and other data. UIState is the visual representation of the AI state.

Import

import { useUIState } from "ai/rsc"
```


API Signature
-------------------------------

### Returns

Similar to useState, it is an array, where the first element is the current UI state and the second element is the function that updates the state.
