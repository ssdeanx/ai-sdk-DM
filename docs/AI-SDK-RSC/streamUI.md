# AI SDK RSC: streamUI

AI SDK RSCstreamUI

AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using AI SDK UI for production. For guidance on migrating from RSC to UI, see our migration guide.

A helper function to create a streamable UI from LLM providers. This function is similar to AI SDK Core APIs and supports the same model interfaces.

To see `streamUI` in action, check out these examples.

Import
-----------------

```ts
import { streamUI } from "ai/rsc"
```

Parameters
-------------------------

The language model to use. Example: openai("gpt-4-turbo")

The initial UI to render.

The system prompt to use that specifies the behavior of the model.

The input prompt to generate the text from.

### messages

Array<CoreSystemMessage | CoreUserMessage | CoreAssistantMessage | CoreToolMessage> | Array<UIMessage>

A list of messages that represent a conversation. Automatically converts UI messages from the useChat hook.

CoreSystemMessage

The role for the system message.

The content of the message.

CoreUserMessage

The role for the user message.

### content

string | Array<TextPart | ImagePart | FilePart>

The content of the message.

TextPart

The type of the message part.

The text content of the message part.

ImagePart

The type of the message part.

### image

string | Uint8Array | Buffer | ArrayBuffer | URL

The image content of the message part. String are either base64 encoded content, base64 data URLs, or http(s) URLs.

The mime type of the image. Optional.

FilePart

The type of the message part.

### data

string | Uint8Array | Buffer | ArrayBuffer | URL

The file content of the message part. String are either base64 encoded content, base64 data URLs, or http(s) URLs.

The mime type of the file.

CoreAssistantMessage

The role for the assistant message.

### content

string | Array<TextPart | ToolCallPart>

The content of the message.

TextPart

The type of the message part.

The text content of the message part.

ToolCallPart

The type of the message part.

The name of the tool, which typically would be the name of the function.

### args

object based on zod schema

Parameters generated by the model to be used by the tool.

CoreToolMessage

### content

Array<ToolResultPart>

The content of the message.

ToolResultPart

The type of the message part.

The id of the tool call the result corresponds to.

The name of the tool the result corresponds to.

The result returned by the tool after execution.

Whether the result is an error or an error message.

Maximum number of tokens to generate.

Temperature setting. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model. It is recommended to set either \`temperature\` or \`topP\`, but not both.

Nucleus sampling. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model. It is recommended to set either \`temperature\` or \`topP\`, but not both.

Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token. Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use temperature.

Presence penalty setting. It affects the likelihood of the model to repeat information that is already in the prompt. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.

Frequency penalty setting. It affects the likelihood of the model to repeatedly use the same words or phrases. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.

Sequences that will stop the generation of the text. If the model generates any of these sequences, it will stop generating further text.

The seed (integer) to use for random sampling. If set and supported by the model, calls will generate deterministic results.

Maximum number of retries. Set to 0 to disable retries. Default: 2.

An optional abort signal that can be used to cancel the call.

### text?

(Text) => ReactNode

Callback to handle the generated tokens from the model.

Text

The full content of the completion.

### providerOptions?

Record<string,Record<string,JSONValue>> | undefined

Provider-specific options. The outer key is the provider name. The inner values are the metadata. Details depend on the provider.

### onFinish?

(result: OnFinishResult) => void

Callback that is called when the LLM response and all request tool executions (for tools that have a \`generate\` function) are finished.

OnFinishResult

The token usage of the generated text.

TokenUsage

The total number of tokens in the prompt.

The total number of tokens in the completion.

The total number of tokens generated.

The final ui node that was generated.

### warnings

Warning\[\] | undefined

Warnings from the model provider (e.g. unsupported settings).

Optional raw response data.

Returns
-------------------

The user interface based on the stream output.

Optional raw response data.

### warnings

Warning\[\] | undefined

Warnings from the model provider (e.g. unsupported settings).

### stream

AsyncIterable<StreamPart> & ReadableStream<StreamPart>

A stream with all events, including text deltas, tool calls, tool results, and errors. You can use it as either an AsyncIterable or a ReadableStream. When an error occurs, the stream will throw the error.

StreamPart

The type to identify the object as text delta.

StreamPart

The type to identify the object as tool call.

### args

object based on zod schema

Parameters generated by the model to be used by the tool.

StreamPart

The type to identify the object as error.

Describes the error that may have occurred during execution.

StreamPart

The type to identify the object as finish.

### finishReason

'stop' | 'length' | 'content-filter' | 'tool-calls' | 'error' | 'other' | 'unknown'

The reason the model finished generating the text.

The token usage of the generated text.

TokenUsage

The total number of tokens in the prompt.

The total number of tokens in the completion.

The total number of tokens generated.
