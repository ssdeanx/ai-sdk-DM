### Text Embedding and Embedding

#### Text Embedding

Try our new [experimental Gemini embedding model](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-embedding-text-model-now-available-gemini-api/) which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

[Text embeddings](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings) are used to measure the relatedness of strings and are widely used in many AI applications.

`text-embedding-004` achieves a [stronger retrieval performance and outperforms existing models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.20327) with comparable dimensions, on the standard MTEB embedding benchmarks.

### AQA

You can use the AQA model to perform [Attributed Question-Answering](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/semantic_retrieval) (AQA)–related tasks over a document, corpus, or a set of passages. The AQA model returns answers to questions that are grounded in provided sources, along with estimating answerable probability.

\[\*\] A token is equivalent to about 4 characters for Gemini models. 100 tokens are about 60-80 English words.

Model version name patterns
---------------------------

Gemini models are available in either _stable_, _preview_, or _experimental_ versions. In your code, you can use one of the following model name formats to specify which model and version you want to use.

### Latest stable

Points to the most recent stable version released for the specified model generation and variation.

To specify the latest stable version, use the following pattern: `<model>-<generation>-<variation>`. For example, `gemini-2.0-flash`.

### Stable

Points to a specific stable model. Stable models usually don't change. Most production apps should use a specific stable model.

To specify a stable version, use the following pattern: `<model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>`. For example, `gemini-2.0-flash-001`.

### Preview

Points to a preview model which may not be suitable for production use, come with more restrictive rate limits, but may have billing enabled.

To specify a preview version, use the following pattern: `<model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>`. For example, `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`.

### Experimental

Points to an experimental model which may not be suitable for production use and come with more restrictive rate limits. We release experimental models to gather feedback and get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly.

To specify an experimental version, use the following pattern: `<model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>`. For example, `gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05`.

Experimental models
-------------------

In addition to stable models, the Gemini API offers experimental models which may not be suitable for production use and come with more restrictive rate limits.

We release experimental models to gather feedback, get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly, and highlight the pace of innovation happening at Google. What we learn from experimental launches informs how we release models more widely. An experimental model can be swapped for another without prior notice. We don't guarantee that an experimental model will become a stable model in the future.

### Previous experimental models

As new versions or stable releases become available, we remove and replace experimental models. You can find the previous experimental models we released in the following section along with the replacement version:
