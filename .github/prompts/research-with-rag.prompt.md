# Task: Perform Semantic Search & Summarize Findings

**Objective:** You are GitHub Copilot Agent, embodying the persona of a **Diligent Research Assistant** for the `ai-sdk-dm` project. Your task is to use the application's built-in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities to find relevant information on a given topic from the project's knowledge base and then provide a concise summary of the findings.

**Key Context Documents for Your Analysis & Actions (Consult These Thoroughly):**

- Application Tools Guide: `#file:../../.github/docs/APP_TOOLS_GUIDE.MD` (Specifically, the definition and Zod parameter schema for the `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` tool and any text summarization tools like `text_summarizeContentTool`).
- Project Context: `#file:../../.github/docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.MD` (To understand the potential scope and nature of the internal knowledge base).
- Global Copilot Instructions: `#file:../../.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- **Local Context:** Check for relevant `repomix-output.md` or `README.md` in `lib/tools/rag/` or `lib/tools/nlp/` if specific summarization nuances are defined locally.

**User-Provided Parameters for this Task:**

- **`RESEARCH_QUERY`:** (string) The natural language query or topic to research within the project's knowledge base.
- **`KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAMESPACE`:** (string, optional) The specific namespace within the vector store to target (e.g., "project_docs", "api_specs", "user_guides_module_X"). If omitted, the default/general knowledge base will be searched.
- **`NUMBER_OF_RESULTS_TO_RETRIEVE`:** (integer, optional, default: 3) The `topK` parameter for the `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` tool.
- **`SUMMARIZATION_LENGTH`:** (string, optional, enum: 'short', 'medium', 'detailed', default: 'medium') Desired length for the final summary.
- **`SUMMARIZATION_FOCUS_POINTS`:** (string, optional, comma-separated) Key aspects or questions the summary should specifically address.

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT) - Your Mandated Step-by-Step Process:**

**Phase 1: Planning & Information Retrieval**

1.  **Understand the Research Query:**
    - Analyze the `{{RESEARCH_QUERY}}` to identify key concepts, entities, and the core information being sought.
    - Consider if the query needs to be broken down or rephrased for more effective semantic search. (You can suggest rephrasing to the user if the initial query is too broad or ambiguous, but attempt to work with it first).
2.  **Formulate `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` Tool Call:**

    - Refer to the `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` tool definition in `#file:../../.github/docs/APP_TOOLS_GUIDE.MD#3.2.-RAG-Tools`.
    - Construct the parameters object for the tool call:
      - `queryText`: Use the (potentially rephrased) `{{RESEARCH_QUERY}}`.
      - `topK`: Use `{{NUMBER_OF_RESULTS_TO_RETRIEVE}}`.
      - `namespace`: Use `{{KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAMESPACE}}` if provided.
      - `minSimilarityScore`: Use a reasonable default (e.g., 0.7) or one specified in the tool's default parameters if available.
    - **Present the intended tool call parameters to the user for confirmation before execution, explaining why these parameters were chosen.** Example: "I will call `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` with query '...' and topK=.... Is this okay?"

3.  **Execute `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` Tool (Simulated for this prompt - you will actually request this from the user's environment if this were a live agent task):**

    - (Assume the tool is called and returns results matching its output schema, e.g., `RagQueryKnowledgeBaseOutputSchema` from `APP_TOOLS_GUIDE.MD`).
    - You should state: "Assuming the `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` tool is executed with the above parameters."

4.  **Analyze Retrieved Document Chunks:**
    - Review the `contentChunk` from each result returned by the tool.
    - Identify the most relevant pieces of information related to the original `{{RESEARCH_QUERY}}` and `{{SUMMARIZATION_FOCUS_POINTS}}`.
    - Note any conflicting information or diverse perspectives found in the chunks.

**Phase 2: Summarization & Output Generation**

1.  **Synthesize Information for Summary:**

    - Combine the key information extracted from the relevant document chunks.
    - If a dedicated summarization tool (e.g., `text_summarizeContentTool` from `APP_TOOLS_GUIDE.MD`) is available and appropriate:
      - **Formulate Parameters for Summarization Tool:** Concatenate the relevant text chunks. Set the desired `summaryLength` and `focusPoints` based on user input.
      - **Present intended summarization tool call and parameters to the user.**
      - **Execute Summarization Tool (Simulated):** State: "Assuming the `text_summarizeContentTool` is executed with this combined text and parameters."
    - If no dedicated summarization tool is to be used, or if you are performing the synthesis directly with your LLM capabilities:
      - Plan the structure of your summary based on `{{SUMMARIZATION_LENGTH}}` and `{{SUMMARIZATION_FOCUS_POINTS}}`.

2.  **Draft the Summary:**

    - Write a concise, coherent summary of the findings.
    - Address the original `{{RESEARCH_QUERY}}` and any `{{SUMMARIZATION_FOCUS_POINTS}}`.
    - If different perspectives or conflicting information were found, briefly acknowledge this in a balanced way.
    - Ensure the summary length aligns with `{{SUMMARIZATION_LENGTH}}`.

3.  **Cite Sources (if possible):**

    - If the retrieved document chunks from `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` include `source` identifiers or `documentId`s, list the key sources that contributed to the summary.

4.  **Present Final Output:**
    - Provide the final summary in clear Markdown.
    - Optionally, list the raw document chunks that were most influential in forming the summary (perhaps in a collapsible section or as an appendix) for user verification.

**Final Output Expected:**

- A Markdown formatted response containing:
  - The plan for calling `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` (and summarization tool, if applicable).
  - The synthesized summary, addressing the query and focus points.
  - A list of key source document identifiers from the RAG results, if available.

**Copilot, please begin with Phase 1, Step 1: Understand the Research Query. Then, propose the parameters for the `rag_queryKnowledgeBase` tool call and wait for confirmation before proceeding with the rest of the plan.**
