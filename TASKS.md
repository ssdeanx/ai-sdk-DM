# AI Agent Onboarding & Cloudflare Migration Tasks (2025)

**Date Created:** 2025-05-24  
**Version:** 1.0
**Lead Developer:** @ssdeanx  
**Repo:** [github.com/ssdeanx/ai-sdk-dm](https://github.com/ssdeanx/ai-sdk-dm)  
**Status:** Pending Implementation  
**Migration Type:** Cloudflare Full Stack (D1, Vectorize, Durable Objects, KV, R2)

## Executive Summary & 2025 AI Agent Context

This task document outlines the migration of a Next.js application utilizing the Vercel AI SDK to a full-stack Cloudflare Workers architecture. It incorporates cutting-edge 2025 AI agent onboarding techniques for autonomous and semi-autonomous execution of tasks. The primary focus is on migrating API endpoints (previously in Next.js App Router, e.g., `#file:app/api/ai-sdk/chat/route.ts`), associated business logic, and data persistence layers to Cloudflare services.

**Core Technologies for Migration:**

- Cloudflare Workers with Hono router
- Cloudflare D1 (SQL database)
- Cloudflare Vectorize (Vector database)
- Cloudflare KV (Key-Value store)
- Cloudflare R2 (Object storage)
- Cloudflare Durable Objects (Stateful coordination)
- Vercel AI SDK (for AI interactions, using Google AI provider - Gemini models)
- Zod (for schema validation)
- TSDoc (for documentation)
- `pnpm` (for package management)

**Project Coding Standards**: All generated code must strictly adhere to the user-provided coding instructions, including error handling, TSDoc, Zod usage, `pnpm`, ID generation (`generateId` from `ai`), security principles, and proactive integration of cross-cutting concerns (logging, tracing, validation).

## Agent Personas & Specialization Framework

### üèóÔ∏è Migration Architect Agent

**Agent Mode Configuration**: `github.copilot.chat.agent.enabled: true`  
**Preferred Models**: Claude Sonnet (latest 4.x), GPT-4 (latest 4.x)
**Specialty**: Cloudflare infrastructure setup (D1, Vectorize, KV, R2, DOs), `wrangler.jsonc` configuration, initial D1 schema design, basic scaffolding of service operation classes.  
**Responsibilities**: Initial setup of Cloudflare services as per `#file:README_TYPES.MD` (Stages 0-3 for infrastructure). Defining D1 table schemas. Configuring all KV, Vectorize, R2, and Durable Object bindings in `#file:workers/wrangler.jsonc`. Scaffolding shells for core Cloudflare service operation classes.  
**Agent Prompts**:

```
You are the Migration Architect Agent. Your primary mission is to establish the complete Cloudflare infrastructure foundation for this project, as detailed in #file:README_TYPES.MD and #file:TASKS.MD (Phase 0).
Key Responsibilities:
1.  **D1 Schema Definition**: Define all necessary D1 table schemas in #file:lib/database/cloudflare/d1/schema.ts. This includes tables for NextAuth.js, as well as any custom tables required for agents, tools, models, R2 metadata, etc.
2.  **Wrangler Configuration**: Fully configure #file:workers/wrangler.jsonc. This includes:
    *   `d1_databases` binding for `DB_D1`.
    *   `kv_namespaces` bindings for `KV_MAIN_CACHE` and `KV_EPHEMERAL_CACHE`.
    *   `r2_buckets` binding for `R2_MAIN_BUCKET`.
    *   `vectorize` binding for `VECTORIZE_MAIN_INDEX` (ensure dimensions match Google AI's text-embedding-004: 768).
    *   `durable_objects` bindings for `DO_AGENT_THREAD` and `DO_PERSONA_PROFILE`, including migration configurations.
3.  **Resource Provisioning Commands**: Provide the exact `wrangler` commands needed to create all KV namespaces, R2 buckets, and Vectorize indexes if they don't exist.
4.  **Service Class Scaffolding**: Create the initial file structure and class shells (empty methods with TSDoc placeholders) for:
    *   `#file:${lib/database/cloudflare/kv/ops.ts}` (CfKvOps)
    *   `#file:${lib/database/cloudflare/r2/ops.ts}` (CfR2Store)
    *   `#file:${lib/database/cloudflare/vectorize/ops.ts}` (CfVectorizeOps)
    *   `#file:${lib/database/cloudflare/durableObjects/agentThreadDO.ts}` (AgentThreadDO)
    *   `#file:${lib/database/cloudflare/durableObjects/personaProfileDO.ts}` (PersonaProfileDO)
    *   `#file:${lib/database/cloudflare/d1/crudService.ts}` (CfD1CrudService - a generic helper beyond NextAuth adapter)
5.  **Verification**: Ensure all configurations allow `wrangler dev` to start successfully with all bindings accessible.
Reference #file:CF-work.txt for Cloudflare best practices and adhere to all project coding standards.

      # wrangler kv:namespace create KV_EPHEMERAL_CACHE --preview # if using preview
      # wrangler r2 bucket create R2_MAIN_BUCKET
      # wrangler vectorize create ai-sdk-dm-vectors --dimensions=768 --metric=cosine
      # For DOs, migrations are handled by wrangler.jsonc and deployments
      ```

- [ ] **Task 0.2**: Scaffold Operation Classes (Migration Architect to create files and class shells with TSDoc placeholders for methods; Integration Engineer to implement fully later):
  - [ ] `#file:lib/database/cloudflare/kv/ops.ts` (CfKvOps class shell: `get`, `put`, `delete`, `list` methods).
  - [ ] `#file:lib/database/cloudflare/r2/ops.ts` (CfR2Store class shell: `put`, `get`, `delete`, `list`, `head` methods).
  - [ ] `#file:lib/database/cloudflare/vectorize/ops.ts` (CfVectorizeOps class shell: `upsert`, `query`, `deleteByIds`, `describeIndex` methods).
  - [ ] `#file:lib/database/cloudflare/durableObjects/agentThreadDO.ts` (AgentThreadDO class shell, extending `DurableObject`, with `fetch` handler and methods for message management, state persistence).
  - [ ] `#file:lib/database/cloudflare/durableObjects/personaProfileDO.ts` (PersonaProfileDO class shell, extending `DurableObject`, with `fetch` handler and methods for profile data management).
  - [ ] `#file:lib/database/cloudflare/d1/crudService.ts` (CfD1CrudService class shell for generic D1 operations: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `list` methods, taking table name and data/query).

#### Phase 1: Worker API Implementation (Integration Engineer Lead)

##### Task 1.1: Core Worker Setup & Hono Router

- [ ] **Task 1.1.1**: Ensure Hono and necessary middleware dependencies are in `workers/package.json` and install using `pnpm`.

  ```bash
  # Agent should verify/execute these commands in the 'workers' directory
  # pnpm add hono @hono/zod-validator @hono/jwt @cloudflare/workers-types zod ai # 'ai' for generateId
  ```

- [ ] **Task 1.1.2**: Implement production-ready worker entrypoint in `#file:workers/src/index.ts`.

  ```typescript
  // filepath: c:\Users\dm\Documents\ai-sdk-DM\workers\src\index.ts
  // TODO: 2025-05-24 - Implement this Hono setup fully.
  // Generated on 2025-05-24
  import { Hono } from 'hono';
  import { AppEnv, MemoryFactory } from '../lib/memory/factory'; // Assuming @ is mapped to ./src or adjust path
  import { authMiddleware } from './middleware/auth';
  import { errorMiddleware } from './middleware/error';
  import { bindingValidationMiddleware } from './middleware/bindings';
  import { requestLoggingMiddleware } from './middleware/logging'; // For request logging
  
  // Import route modules
  import healthRoutes from './routes/health';
  import aiSdkChatRoutes from './routes/ai-sdk/chat';
  import aiSdkAgentRoutes from './routes/ai-sdk/agents';
  import aiSdkToolRoutes from './routes/ai-sdk/tools';
  import aiSdkModelRoutes from './routes/ai-sdk/models';
  // Add other ai-sdk route imports if they exist e.g., files, etc.

  export type HonoAppContext = {
    Variables: {
      user?: { id: string; role: string; [key: string]: any }; // User is optional until auth middleware runs
      memoryFactory: MemoryFactory;
      requestId?: string; // For tracing/logging
    };
    Bindings: AppEnv; // AppEnv should be defined in factory.ts or a shared types file
  };
  
  const app = new Hono<HonoAppContext>();
  
  // 0. Request ID and Logging Middleware (runs first)
  app.use('*', requestLoggingMiddleware);

  // 1. Global error handler (catches errors from subsequent middleware/routes)
  app.onError(errorMiddleware);

  // 2. Global MemoryFactory middleware
  app.use('*', async (c, next) => {
    try {
      const factory = new MemoryFactory(c.env as AppEnv); // Ensure AppEnv is correctly typed
      c.set('memoryFactory', factory);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("CRITICAL: Failed to initialize MemoryFactory", e);
      return c.json({ error: "Internal Server Error - Critical component initialization failed" }, 500);
    }
    await next();
  });
  
  // 3. Binding validation for API routes (after MemoryFactory so it can potentially use it for checks if needed)
  app.use('/api/*', bindingValidationMiddleware);

  // 4. Auth middleware for protected API routes
  app.use('/api/ai-sdk/*', authMiddleware); // Apply to all ai-sdk routes

  // 5. Register routes
  app.route('/health', healthRoutes); // Public health check
  app.route('/api/ai-sdk/chat', aiSdkChatRoutes);
  app.route('/api/ai-sdk/agents', aiSdkAgentRoutes);
  app.route('/api/ai-sdk/tools', aiSdkToolRoutes);
  app.route('/api/ai-sdk/models', aiSdkModelRoutes);
  // Register other ai-sdk routes here if they exist

  export default app;
  ```

- [ ] **Task 1.1.3**: Implement health check endpoint in `#file:workers/src/routes/health.ts`.
  This Hono route should use `c.get('memoryFactory').runHealthChecks()` to verify D1, KV, R2, Vectorize, and DO connectivity.

  ```typescript
  // filepath: c:\Users\dm\Documents\ai-sdk-DM\workers\src\routes\health.ts
  // TODO: 2025-05-24 - Ensure MemoryFactory.runHealthChecks() is implemented and returns detailed status for each service.
  // Generated on 2025-05-24
  import { Hono } from 'hono';
  import { HonoAppContext } from '../index';
  
  const healthRoutes = new Hono<HonoAppContext>();
  
  healthRoutes.get('/', async (c) => {
    const factory = c.get('memoryFactory');
    let checks: Record<string, { status: string; details?: string }> = {};
    let overallStatus: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy' = 'unhealthy';
    let httpStatus = 503; // Service Unavailable
  
    try {
      checks = await factory.runHealthChecks(); // This method needs to be implemented in MemoryFactory
      const allOk = Object.values(checks).every(service => service.status === 'ok');
      const anyCriticalError = Object.values(checks).some(service => service.status === 'error' && service.details?.includes('critical')); // Define what's critical

      if (allOk) {
        overallStatus = 'healthy';
        httpStatus = 200;
      } else if (!anyCriticalError) {
        overallStatus = 'degraded';
        httpStatus = 200; // Still OK, but with warnings
      } else {
        overallStatus = 'unhealthy'; // Critical service down
      }
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error(`Health check execution failed: ${error.message}`, error);
      checks = { system: { status: 'error', details: error.message || 'Unknown error during health check execution' } };
    }
    return c.json({ status: overallStatus, checks, timestamp: new Date().toISOString(), requestId: c.get('requestId') }, httpStatus);
  });
  
  export default healthRoutes;
  ```

##### Task 1.2: Core Middleware & `MemoryFactory` Implementation

- [ ] **Task 1.2.1**: (Migration Architect to verify bindings from Task 0.1 are complete and correct in `#file:workers/wrangler.jsonc`).
- [ ] **Task 1.2.2**: (Integration Engineer) Fully implement `#file:lib/memory/factory.ts`.
  - Define `AppEnv` interface (e.g., `export interface AppEnv { DB_D1: D1Database; KV_MAIN_CACHE: KVNamespace; /* ...all other bindings... */ }`).
  - Constructor `constructor(env: AppEnv)` that initializes instances of all service operation classes (CfD1CrudService, CfKvOps, CfR2Store, CfVectorizeOps).
  - Provide typed public getters for each service instance and for DO stubs (e.g., `getAgentThreadDO(id: DurableObjectId | string): DurableObjectStub`).
  - Implement `async runHealthChecks(): Promise<Record<string, { status: string; details?: string }>>`. Each check should `try/catch` and report 'ok' or 'error' with details. For DOs, this might involve a simple `fetch` to a health endpoint on the DO itself.
- [ ] **Task 1.2.3**: (Integration Engineer) Implement binding validation middleware in `#file:workers/src/middleware/bindings.ts`.

  ```typescript
  // filepath: c:\Users\dm\Documents\ai-sdk-DM\workers\src\middleware\bindings.ts
  // TODO: 2025-05-24 - Ensure requiredBindings list is comprehensive and matches AppEnv and wrangler.jsonc.
  // Generated on 2025-05-24
  import { MiddlewareHandler } from 'hono';
  import { HonoAppContext } from '../index';
  import { AppEnv } from '../../lib/memory/factory'; // Assuming AppEnv is exported here
  
  export const bindingValidationMiddleware: MiddlewareHandler<HonoAppContext> = async (c, next) => {
    const requiredBindings: (keyof AppEnv)[] = [
      'DB_D1', 
      'KV_MAIN_CACHE',
      'KV_EPHEMERAL_CACHE',
      'R2_MAIN_BUCKET',
      'VECTORIZE_MAIN_INDEX',
      'DO_AGENT_THREAD',
      'DO_PERSONA_PROFILE',
      // Add ALL other essential bindings defined in AppEnv
    ];
    const actualEnv = c.env as Record<string, unknown>;
    const missingBindings = requiredBindings.filter(bindingKey => !actualEnv[bindingKey]);
  
    if (missingBindings.length > 0) {
      const errorMsg = `Server configuration error: Missing required Cloudflare bindings. Missing: ${missingBindings.join(', ')}`;
      console.error(errorMsg, { requestId: c.get('requestId') });
      return c.json({ error: errorMsg, requestId: c.get('requestId') }, 500);
    }
    await next();
  };
  ```

- [ ] **Task 1.2.4**: (Integration Engineer) Implement error handling middleware in `#file:workers/src/middleware/error.ts`.

  ```typescript
  // filepath: c:\Users\dm\Documents\ai-sdk-DM\workers\src\middleware\error.ts
  // TODO: 2025-05-24 - Enhance with structured logging (e.g., to an external service if configured).
  // Generated on 2025-05-24
  import { ErrorHandler } from 'hono';
  import { HonoAppContext } from '../index';
  import { HTTPException } from 'hono/http-exception'; // For typed HTTP errors
  
  export const errorMiddleware: ErrorHandler<HonoAppContext> = (err, c) => {
    const requestId = c.get('requestId');
    let statusCode = 500;
    let message = 'An unexpected error occurred.';
  
    if (err instanceof HTTPException) {
      statusCode = err.status;
      message = err.message;
    } else if (err instanceof Error) {
      message = err.message; // Potentially sensitive, be careful in prod
    }
  
    // Log the detailed error internally
    console.error(`Error during ${c.req.method} ${c.req.url}: ${message}`, { 
      error: err, // Full error object for internal logs
      stack: (err as Error).stack,
      requestId 
    });
    
    // For client-facing errors, especially 5xx, avoid leaking sensitive details in production
    const clientErrorMessage = (statusCode >= 500 && (c.env as any).WORKER_ENV === 'production') 
        ? 'Internal Server Error. Please try again later.' 
        : message;

    return c.json({ error: clientErrorMessage, requestId }, statusCode);
  };
  ```

- [ ] **Task 1.2.5**: (Integration Engineer) Implement authentication middleware in `#file:workers/src/middleware/auth.ts`.
  This middleware should:
    1. Expect a JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
    2. Use a JWT library (e.g., `@hono/jwt` or a platform-agnostic one like `jose`) to verify the token against secrets/keys (presumably from `c.env`).
    3. If valid, extract user information (id, role) from the token payload.
    4. Set `c.set('user', userData)`.
    5. If invalid or missing, return a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` `HTTPException`.
- [ ] **Task 1.2.6**: (Integration Engineer) Implement request logging middleware in `#file:workers/src/middleware/logging.ts`.
  This middleware should:
    1. Generate a unique request ID (e.g., using `generateId` from `ai`) if one doesn't exist (e.g., from `CF-Ray`).
    2. Set `c.set('requestId', id)`.
    3. Log basic request info (method, URL, requestId) at the start.
    4. Log response info (status, requestId, duration) after `await next()`.

##### Task 1.3: API Endpoint Migration & Implementation (Focus: `ai-sdk` routes)

**General Approach for each `ai-sdk` sub-route (Integration Engineer):**

1. **Identify Old Route**: Note the functionality of the old Next.js API route (e.g., `#file:app/api/ai-sdk/chat/route.ts`).
2. **Create New Hono Route File**: e.g., `#file:workers/src/routes/ai-sdk/chat.ts`.
3. **Define Hono Routes**: Implement handlers for POST, GET, etc., using `const subApp = new Hono<HonoAppContext>()`.
4. **Input Validation**: Use Zod schemas defined in a new domain-specific file (e.g., `#file:lib/shared/types/chatTypes.ts`) for request bodies/params. Use `@hono/zod-validator`.
5. **Access Services**: Use `c.get('memoryFactory')` to get instances of `CfD1CrudService`, `CfVectorizeOps`, `CfKvOps`, `CfR2Store`, DO stubs, etc.
6. **Business Logic**: Implement core logic in a new service file (e.g., `#file:lib/chat/chat-service.ts`), using Vercel AI SDK functions (`streamText`, `generateId`, `embed` with Google AI: `embeddingModalId: 'google/text-embedding-004'`) and custom logic. All service methods must be `async` and use `try/catch`.
7. **Types**: Define request/response TypeScript types in the domain-specific types file, often inferred from Zod schemas.
8. **Error Handling**: Wrap service calls in `try/catch` within Hono handlers. Throw `HTTPException` for client errors, let global error handler catch server errors.
9. **TSDoc**: Document all new functions, types, Zod schemas, etc.
10. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Ensure logging, tracing (if set up), ID generation, and Zod validation are applied.

- [ ] **Task 1.3.1**: Migrate functionality from old Next.js `#file:app/api/ai-sdk/chat/route.ts` (and any related dynamic segments like `/app/api/ai-sdk/chat/[threadId]/route.ts`) to new Hono routes in `#file:workers/src/routes/ai-sdk/chat.ts`.

- [ ] **Task 1.3.3**: Migrate functionality from old Next.js `#file:app/api/ai-sdk/tools/route.ts` (and related dynamic segments) to new Hono routes in `#file:workers/src/routes/ai-sdk/tools.ts`.
  - Business logic for tool management (listing, fetching definitions) in a new `#file:lib/tools/tool-service.ts`.
  - Types/Zod schemas in a new `#file:lib/shared/types/toolTypes.ts` (e.g., `ToolDefinitionSchema`).
  - Store tool definitions/configurations in D1.
- [ ] **Task 1.3.4**: Migrate functionality from old Next.js `#file:app/api/ai-sdk/models/route.ts` (and related dynamic segments) to new Hono routes in `#file:workers/src/routes/ai-sdk/models.ts`.
  - Business logic for AI model configuration management (listing available, fetching details) in a new `#file:lib/models/model-service.ts`.
  - Types/Zod schemas in a new `#file:lib/shared/types/modelTypes.ts` (e.g., `ModelConfigSchema`).
  - Store model settings in D1 or KV (for simpler, less relational data).
- [ ] **Task 1.3.5**: Ensure all new business logic service files (e.g., `#file:lib/chat/chat-service.ts`) are created, well-structured, use `MemoryFactory`, and correctly incorporate Vercel AI SDK with Google AI provider. All methods must be async and include try/catch.
- [ ] **Task 1.3.6**: Ensure all new type and Zod schema files (e.g., `#file:lib/shared/types/chatTypes.ts`) are created, correctly define data structures, and are used for validation in Hono routes.

## 2025 GitHub Copilot Agent Integration

### Agent Mode Best Practices

#### Autonomous Iteration Patterns

```typescript
// Example: Agent should automatically iterate until tests pass
// 1. Generate initial implementation
// 2. Run tests automatically
// 3. Detect failures and fix them
// 4. Iterate until all tests pass
// 5. Validate integration points
```

#### MCP Server Integration

```json
// .vscode/mcp-servers.json - Agent should configure these
{
  "cloudflare-bindings": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse"]
  },
  "cloudflare": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse"]
  },
  "cloudflare-builds": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["mcp-remote@latest", "https://builds.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse"]
  }
}
```

#### Terminal Command Automation

Agents should automatically suggest and execute:

```bash
# Package management
pnpm install <dependencies>

# Cloudflare operations  
wrangler d1 migrations apply
wrangler vectorize create
wrangler secret put

# Testing
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm deploy
```
